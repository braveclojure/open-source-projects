 "Open Source is the repo for the site you're looking at! It uses reagent, re-frame, boot, compojure, and more. There are also ansible roles that can serve as an example. It's kind of funky in that it uses the github project https://github.com/braveclojure/open-source-projects as its database.\n\nThere's still much I want to do to improve the code so that it can be an even better example of a Clojure/Script app.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute, visit the repo and create an issue or make a pull request. You can find me in clojurians slack, @nonrecursive."}
